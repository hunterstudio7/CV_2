# Cubic Balance
> This game was created on Unity. The gameplay is about balancing the cubes. You can build various towers, but you need to be careful and think everything in advance so that your structure does not collapse into small cubes. The game ends when you out of balance or it is impossible to build the next cube. The main task is to gain more and more points each time, but nobody canceled your creativity either! Also, an additional interest is to gain more and more records in order to discover new colors of cubes, which can be obtained in the record store.

## Gameplay


The cube appears every second, it shows the places where you can place the cubes. If you tap on the screen the cube will appear in the same place. The main thing is to have time to click on the screen so that your tower does not lose balance, otherwise the game will be over.

## End of the game

When you lose balance or the next cubes cannot be placed, this means that the game is over and the camera moves away along with the shaking to make the effect of a large object falling. The strength of the shaking increases with the height of the tower.
